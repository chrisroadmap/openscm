Code of Conduct
===============

We as contributors and maintainers want to foster an open and
welcoming environment around the OpenSCM project. To that end, we have
a few ground rules that we ask everyone to adhere to. This code
applies equally to everyone involved in the project.

This is not an exhaustive list of things that you cannot do. Rather,
take it in the spirit in which it is intended - a guide to make it
easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the OpenSCM
project. This includes mailing lists, the issue tracker, group calls,
and any other forums of the project. In addition, violations of this
code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate
within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that
you report it by emailing the maintainers listed in the README.

-  Be friendly and patient.
-  Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and
   supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes,
   but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture,
   national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic
   class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity
   and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
   religion, and mental and physical ability.
-  Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in
   turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will
   affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences
   into account when making decisions.
-  Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but
   disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We
   might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot
   allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is
   important to remember that a community where people feel
   uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Everyone
   involved in the project should be respectful when dealing with
   others.
-  Be careful in the words that you choose. We want to be a community
   of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind
   to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment
   and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes,
   but is not limited to:

   -  Violent threats or language directed against another person.
   -  Discriminatory jokes and language.
   -  Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
   -  Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally
      identifying information ("doxing").
   -  Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
   -  Unwelcome sexual attention.
   -  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
   -  Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you
      to stop, then stop.

-  When others disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social
   and technical, happen all the time and this project is no exception. It
   is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
   constructively. Different people have different perspectives on
   issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint
   does not mean that they are wrong. Do not forget that it is human to
   err and blaming each other does not get us anywhere. Instead, focus
   on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
