# Contributing

[Think we can mainly just copy stuff from MAGICC's contributing guide]

In order to contribute, you will also need to have some familiarity with the following tools:

- git 
- tests
- make

If you are not familiar with these tools, we suggest you check out the following resources from software carpentry, they each take about 5 hours to complete.

- [git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- [tests](https://v4.software-carpentry.org/test/index.html) and [getting started with mocking](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-mocking-in-python)
- [make](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/)
